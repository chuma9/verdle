# verdle
    like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) but without the yellow squares. Only the ~~verde~~ green ones! 

    After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word. Unlike Wordle, this game does not highlight letters that are in the word but in the the wrong spot or letters
    that are not in the word at all.
